# gptc - GPT ‚ù§Ô∏è CLI

Supercharge your CLI with the power of OpenAI's GPT model (and other models too!), generate script without leaving the terminal, one-click command explanation, and interactive chat with GPT all in one place.

A large part of this tool is actually written by GPT-4 üß†

## Install

You can install this tool by downloading the release archive directly from GitHub or use `homebrew`
```{bash}
brew tap junyu-w/gptc git@github.com:junyu-w/homebrew-gptc.git
brew install gptc
```
To upgrade to the latest version (make sure you had run the `brew tap` command above already), run
```{bash}
brew upgrade
```

## How to use?

It's as simple as typing `gptc` in your terminal, and we'll walk you through the rest from configuration to your first request üôå

Additionally, if you would like to just start an interactive chat with GPT about anything beyond just bash script or command, simply type 
```
gptc chat
````
and you'll have the ChatGPT experience right in the terminal!
